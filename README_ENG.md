## Dependent environment

`Mrdoc` is developed on `Python 3.6` + `Django 2.2`, and tested well on Django 2.1, 2.2 and python 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7. Running mrdoc in other environments does not exclude unknown exceptions.

## Simple Installation Tutorial

### 1. install dependent modules
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. configure database info

By default, mrdoc uses Django's SQLite database. If you use SQLite database, you do not need to configure another database.

If you need to configure other databases, please first follow Django's official [database support instructions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/zh-hans/2.2/ref/databases/),Install a python binding library for a specific database.

Then open it in the `/mrdoc/config` directory `conig.ini` File, modify according to your own database information:

```python
# engine，指定数据库类型，接受sqlite、mysql、oracle、postgresql
engine = sqlite
# name表示数据库的名称
# name = db_name
# user表示数据库用户名
# user = db_user
# password表示数据库用户密码
# password = db_pwd
# host表示数据库主机地址
# host = db_host
# port表示数据库端口
# port = db_port
```

### 3. Initialize database

After installing the required third-party library and configuring the database information, we need to initialize the database.

Open the command line interface under the project path and run the following command to generate the database migration:

```
python manage.py makemigrations 
```

Run the following command to perform database migration:

```
python manage.py migrate
```

After execution, the database is initialized.

### 4. Create Super User

After initializing the database, you need to create an administrator account to manage the whole mrdoc. Open the command line terminal in the project path and run the following command:

```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to enter the user name, email address and password.

### 5、Test Running

After completing the above steps, you can run and use mrdoc.

In the test environment, you can use the server provided by Django to run mrdoc. The command is:

```
python manage.py runserver
```
